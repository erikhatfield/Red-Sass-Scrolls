# RED SASS SCROLLS - the README #

## A NodeJS HTML5 app compiled and built upon Brunch.io's action packed package.

* * *

### What the project does
This project is intended as an example of my coding styles, best practices and graphic design sense, as well as general UX- *'what am I even looking at?'*

#### Technical:
1. __HTML5__
2. __CSS3__ - compiled from Sass/SCSS
3. __Javascript__ - ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
4. __jQuery__ 3.3
5. __NodeJS__ => __NPM__ with Brunch.io - Code compiling, linting, watching, minifing, and optimizing.

#### Creative:
1. __Graphic Design__ - elegant and simplistic GUI
2. __Interactive Design__ - scrolling transitions and animations
3. __User Experience__ - works beautifully, feels good
4. __Web-fonts__ - community sourced typography
	* _Shkoder 1986_ - Edgy triangular 1980s style typeface authored by [Julian](https://www.behance.net/julianhxh) and [Ana](https://www.behance.net/anahoxha) :two_hearts:
	* _Heebo Thin_ - nice light-weight font with :abcd:__bonus:__ [Paleo Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet) alphabet characters and symbols. Font provided by [edenberger](https://github.com/edenberger/Paleo-Hebrew-Heebo-Font) :thumbsup: with inspiration provided by the Dead Sea Squirrels... -err i mean - Scrolls :squirrel:

## Live Demo (coming soon to a URL near you)
Using the built code in the 'public' dir, I will host a static demo site. _Coming Soon!_ - (:date:013018)

### How you can get started with the project's code 

*First things first, the public directory is the stand-alone and static portion of the project and you can jump into that without dealing with any installations, compilations, or complications such as project/package dependencies.* :beginner:

#### Installing Requirements & Dependencies

* __System Requirements:__
	* [Node.js + NPM](http://nodejs.org) Node's Package Manager: `brew install node` on OSX if you have homebrew -or you can use Yum on Linux. Among other ways.
	* [Brunch.io](http://brunch.io) for epic out-of-the-box features and plugins including a Sass compiler: `npm install -g brunch`
* __Project Dependencies:__ from within the project directory, install plugins and app dependencies listed in package.json: `npm install`

#### Building, Compiling, and :running: the code 
* Run:
	* `npm start` — watches the code with automatic rebuild. This will also launch the NodeJS HTTP localhost server with [HTML5's History pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
	* `brunch watch --server` — same as command 'npm start'
	* `npm run build` — builds minified project in ./public dir for free-spirit static site.

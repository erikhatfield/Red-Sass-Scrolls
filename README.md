# RED SASS SCROLLS - the README #

## A NodeJS HTML5 app compiled and built upon Brunch.io's action packed package.

* * *

### What the project does
This project is intended as an example of my coding styles, best practices and graphic design sense, as well as general UX- *'what am I even looking at?'*

#### Technical:
1. __HTML5__
2. __CSS3__ - compiled from Sass/SCSS
3. __Javascript__ - ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6)
4. __jQuery__ 3.3
5. __NodeJS__ and __NPM__ with Brunch.io - Code linting, watching, minifing, and optimizing.

#### Creative:
1. __Graphic Design__ - beautiful and simple GUI
2. __Interactive Design__ - transitions and animations
3. __User Experience__ - works beautifully, feels good
4. __Web-fonts__ - community sourced typography
	* _Shkoder 1986_ - Edgy triangular 1980s style authored by [Julian](https://www.behance.net/julianhxh) and [Ana](https://www.behance.net/anahoxha) :two_hearts:

Font provided by [edenberger](https://github.com/edenberger/Paleo-Hebrew-Heebo-Font) :thumbsup: with inspiration provided by the Dead Sea Squirrels... -err i mean - Scrolls :squirrel:

## Live Demo (coming soon to a url near you)
Using the built code in the 'public' dir, I will host a static demo site. _Coming Soon!_ - 013018:date:

### How you can get started with the project's code 

*First things first, the public directory is the stand-alone and static portion of the project and you can jump into that without dealing with any project/package dependencies.* :beginner:

#### Installing Requirements & Dependencies

* __Requirements:__ Install (if you don't have them):
	* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) w/ Node's Package Manager - __NPM__: `brew install node` on OS X
	* [Brunch](http://brunch.io) for epic plugins including a Sass compiler: `npm install -g brunch`
* __Dependencies:__ Project plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`

#### Building, Compiling, and :running: the code 
* Run:
	* `npm start` — watches the code with automatic rebuild. This will also launch the NodeJS HTTP localhost server with [HTML5's History pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
	* `brunch watch --server` — same as command 'npm start'
	* `npm run build` — builds minified project in ./public dir for free-spirit static site.

##### Brunch.io Features
* [jQuery3](http://jquery.com)
* Compilation of ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6) files with [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
* Uglification and concatenation of Javascript files with [UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/)
* Extending CSS with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and sass-lint
* Autoprefixing, concatenation, minification (and more) of CSS files with [Pleeease (PostCSS)](http://pleeease.io)
* Auto reload of development server port:3333
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org) with [Standard Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/standard)
* Ready to format your code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* index.html with essential meta tags for SEO and Social Media
